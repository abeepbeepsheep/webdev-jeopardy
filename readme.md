### WDI Jeopardy by Morgan Murrah - v2.1

This game started as one of my first ever web projects and was my first application of HTML, CSS, Javsacript and JQuery. This game has been simplified/ a lot of refactoring of my horrible earlier code. The game now makes use of the new CSS Grid specification [which is not fully supported yet](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid). 

In 2020, I have decided as a learning exercise to attempt to dockerize this project.
