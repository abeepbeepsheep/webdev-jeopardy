### WDI Jeopardy by Morgan Murrah - v2.0

This game was started as my earliest project wirh General Assembly Atlanta and was my first application of HTML, CSS, Javscript and JQuery. I am adding bits and pieces to it since then.

### Current version: V2.0:

This game has been GREATLY simplified/ a lot of the junk cut out... and now it is in progress to becoming a a very basic Progressive Web App. !

It also makes use of the new CSS Grid specification, which entails some bleeding-edge problems with older browsers.

#### Future develoment:

* Make the game competitive/two player
* Add a high-score table, or way of saving/sharing a score result

#### Technologies used in this game include:

 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * Bootstrap 3.3.7
 * JQuery/Ajax
